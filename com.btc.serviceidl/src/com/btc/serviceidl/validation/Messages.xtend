    public static val IDENTIFIER_NAME_IS_KEYWORD = "This identifier is either a reserved keyword in C++, Java or C#, or it is used by the Protobuf compiler in the generated code! Please choose another name."

    public static val NAME_COLLISION = "Name collision: names of modules/interfaces have to be unique"

    public static val FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORED_BY_CAB = "Currently there is no CAB support for this feature, so it has no effect on the generated code"

    public static val TUPLE_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED = "The tuple type is currently not supported by the generator! Use a struct instead!"

    public static val CIRCULAR_INHERITANCE = "Circular inheritance detected! One of this type's base types is derived from this type itself."

    public static val NAME_COLLISION_MEMBERS = "Name collision of members in base class and derived class"

    public static val NAME_COLLISION_PARAMETERS = "Name collision of method parameters"

    public static val TYPE_NOT_CONSTRUCTIBLE = "It is impossible to create an instance of this type due to mutual dependencies! Either resolve mutual dependencies or mark dependent types as optional!"

    public static val EXTERNAL_CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCIES = "External circular dependencies are currently not supported! Awaiting C++17..."

    public static val ALIAS_SEQUENCES_NOT_SUPPORTED = "It's not trivial to represent alias sequences in Protobuf in a stable way, therefore they are currently not supported by the generator! You can easily wrap a sequences in an extra struct, if you want to alias them."

    public static val NESTED_SEQUENCES_NOT_SUPPORTED = "It's not trivial to represent nested sequences in Protobuf in a stable way, therefore they are currently not supported by the generator! You can easily wrap a sequences in an extra struct, if you want to nest them."

    public static val EXCEPTION_REFERENCE_NOT_SUPPORTED = "There is currently no concept how to use exception references in practice, therefore they are turned off"

    public static val IMMUTABLE_OUTPUT_PARAMETER = "Immutable types cannot be used as output parameters in Java! Workaround: wrap it into a struct."

    public static val DUPLICATE_EXCEPTION_TYPES = "Same exception type is used multiple times!"

    public static val DEPRECATED_NESTED_TYPE_DECLARATION = "This IDL feature is deprecated due to its unmanageable and unnecessary complexity! Do not use nested type declarations! Instead, declare them as separate types!"

    public static val DEPRECATED_ADHOC_DECLARATION = "This IDL feature is deprecated due to its uselessness along with high maintenance costs! Use a normal struct member instead!"
    
    public static val DEPRECATED_VERSION_DECLARATION = "Declaring versions on an interface is now deprecated and has no effect, declare the version at the IDL level instead!"
